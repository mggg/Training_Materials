    "Elections are the systems or algorithms by which a `PreferenceProfile`, or collection of ballots, is converted into an outcome. There are infinitely many different possible election methods, whether the output is a single winner, a set of winners, or a consensus ranking. VoteKit has a host of built-in election methods, as well as the functionality to let you create your own system of election. By the end of this section, you will have been introduced to the STV and Borda elections, learned about the `Election` object, and created your own election type."
