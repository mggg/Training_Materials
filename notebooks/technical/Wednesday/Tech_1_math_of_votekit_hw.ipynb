    "The first order of business is ballots. In the context of ranked choice voting, a ballot records a voter's preferences as a linear ordering of the candidates. If a voter casts the ballot $A>B>C$, this means they prefer candidate $A$ to $B$ and candidate $B$ to $C$. (We often use the $>$ symbol to indicate higher preference.) Let's see how ballots are stored in VoteKit. First we import the necessary modules."

    "## Generating Preference Intervals from Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen a few ballot generators, we can introduce the candidate simplex and the Dirichlet distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that you can initialize the Plackett-Luce model and the Bradley-Terry model from a preference interval (or multiple ones if you have different voting blocs). Recall, a preference interval stores a voter's preference for candidates as a vector of non-negative values that sum to 1. Other models that rely on preference intervals include the Alternating Crossover model (AC) and the Cambridge Sampler (CS). There is a nice geometric representation of preference intervals via the candidate simplex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Candidate Simplex\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, the candidate simplex is a geometric representation of the space of preference intervals. With two candidates, it is an interval; with three candidates, it is a triangle; with four, a tetrahedron; and so on getting harder to visualize as the dimension goes up.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be easiest to visualize with three candidates $A,B,C$. Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between positions in the triangle and what are called **convex combinations** of the extreme points.  For instance, $.8A+.15B+.05C$ is a weighted average of those points giving 80% of the weight to $A$, 15% to $B$, and 5% to $C$.  The result is a point that is closest to $A$, as seen in the picture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Those coefficients, which sum to 1, become the lengths of the candidate's sub-intervals.  So this lets us see the simplex as the space of all preference intervals.\n",

    "### Dirichlet Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dirichlet distributions** are a one-parameter family of probability distributions on the simplex---this is used here to choose a preference interval at random. We parameterize it with a value $\\alpha \\in (0,\\infty)$. As $\\alpha\\to \\infty$, the support of the distribution moves to the center of the simplex. This means we are more likely to sample preference intervals that have roughly equal support for all candidates, which will translate to all orderings being equally likely. As $\\alpha\\to 0$, the mass moves to the vertices. This means we are more likely to choose a preference interval that has strong support for a single candidate.  In between is $\\alpha=1$, where any region of the simplex is weighted in proportion to its area.  We think of this as the \"all bets are off\" setting -- you might choose a balanced preference, a concentrated preference, or something in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value $\\alpha$ is never allowed to equal 0 or $\\infty$ in Python, so VoteKit changes these to a very small number ($10^{-10}$) and a very large number $(10^{20})$.  We don't recommend using values that extreme. In previous studies, MGGG members have taken $\\alpha = 1/2$ to be \"small\" and $\\alpha = 2$ to be \"big.\"\n",

Eliminated candidates are filled in in the order they were eliminated, bottom-up.  If any candidates are still remaining without having been designated elected or eliminated, they are in a middle category called `Remaining`.  Ties are broken by strength, meaning for instance that if 3 candidates are remaining at the end, they are listed in the order of their first-place in the final election state.

    "So what exactly is happening in this STV election? STV stands for \"single transferable vote.\" Voters cast ranked choice ballots. A threshold is set of how much support is required for election; if a candidate crosses the threshold, they are designated as a winner. The threshold in VoteKit defaults to something called the **Droop quota**. If there are $N$ voters and $m$ seats, then Droop quota is computed as $T=\\lfloor N/(m+1)\\rfloor +1$. Another option is the **Hare quota**, which is just $T=N/m$, which is a little bit larger. Generally, all that is needed of a threshold is that it can't be the case that $m+1$ candidates exceed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first round, the first-place votes for each candidate are tallied. If candidate $A$ crosses the threshold, they are elected. If there were surplus votes, then the ballots with $A$ in first place are transfered, with appropriately reduced weight, to the next choice of those voters. If another candidate receives enough transfered support to cross the threshold, they are elected. If no candidate does, the candidate with the fewest first-place votes is removed from all ballots, and their votes are transfered with full weight. This repeats until all seats are filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work out a small example where it is easier to see how STV works. We will use a fractional transfer rule. If the threshold is $T$ and a candidate received $rT$ votes in a given round, where $r>1$, then the excess is $(r-1)T$ and so ballots are now \"discounted\" to have new weight $(r-1)/r$. For instance if the candidate received 150 votes but only needed 100, there would be 50 \"excess\" votes.  Instead of randomly picking 50 out of 150 ballots to transfer, we transfer them all with a reduced weight of 50/150, or 1/3.  Here is a [link](https://mggg.org/publications/political-geometry/20-WeighillDuchin.pdf) to a more substantial explainer about ranked choice.\n",

    "There are many different possible election methods, both for choosing a single seat or multiple seats. `VoteKit` has a host of built-in election methods, as well as the functionality to let you create your own kind of election. You have been introduced to the STV and Borda elections and learned about the `Election` object. This should allow you to model any kind of elections you see in the real world, including rules that have not yet been implemented in `VoteKit`."
