This cast vote record was already cleaned by the City of Minneapolis, and they chose this way of parsing the ballots: ‘undervote’ indicates that the voter left a position unfilled, such as by having no candidate listed in second place. The ‘overvote’ notation arises when a voter puts two candidates in one position, like by putting Hodges and Samuels both in first place. Unfortunately this way of storing the profile means we have lost any knowledge of the voter intent (which was probably to indicate equal preference). ‘UWI’ stands for unregistered write-in.\n",

We will then move up lower ranked candidates to replace the removed non-candidates. The `remove_and_condense` function does this for us."
