The ‘overvote’ notation arises when a voter puts two candidates in one position, like by putting Hodges and Samuels both in first place. Unfortunately this way of storing the profile means we have lost any knowledge of the voter intent (which was probably to indicate equal preference). ‘UWI’ stands for unregistered write-in.\n",
