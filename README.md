# June Training for VoteKit in 2025

## Day 1 - "Hello World"

Idea: Notebook should serve as a reference for the python newbies

Note: Should probably do this as a live coding session

Learning Goals:

By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:

    * Manipulate basic Python data types
    * Understand the basic syntax of a function
    * Be able to use a for loop
    * Understand basic use of lists and dictionaries
    * Be able to open a file in colab


Outline:

    - Working with basic types in python
        - Variables: Assignment, Equality, and 'is'
            - Idea is to go back to high-school algebra
        - Ints (super easy, just be careful about /, //, and %)
        - Booleans
            - Very special
        - Strings
            - Concatenation (both as + and right next to each other)
            - Formatted strings
            - Mention other things, but say don't worry about them (multi-line, raw, byte)
    - Functions
        - We like them because they keep us from repeating ourselves
        - View them as a set of instructions
        - Introduce "print" here
    - Basic data structures
        - Lists
            - Don't forget the sort function
        - Dictionaries (Maps)
    - Looping in python
        - For loops
        - For _ in _
        - While loops -- they exist, but don't worry about them
    - Some libraries to know about
        - NumPy (I want to add 1 to everything without a loop)
        - Pandas (Spreadsheets for python)
        - GeoPandas
    - Moving files around
    - Opening a file
        - CSV
        - Xcel
        - Parquet
        - Shapefile

Other notes:

    - When working with Pandas dataframes later, we will want to use the explicit 'filter' and
        'join' operations
